# Spectral Zeta Coherence: Prime Waves and Hadronic Analogies

This repository contains supplementary code and visualizations for the ongoing research project "La Zêta de Cohérence".

## Overview
We explore wave-based constructions derived from prime numbers and their resonance with Riemann zeta zeros. The work aims to build bridges between number theory and quantum hadronic physics.

## Contents
- `technical_paper/`: LaTeX source for the technical overview paper.
- `figures/`: Generic visualizations (prime waves, explicit formula comparisons).
- `code/`: Python scripts generating the figures (with example parameters).

## Note
This is an active research project. The full numerical results and optimized parameters will be released upon publication.
