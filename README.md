# Spectral Zeta Coherence: Prime Waves and Hadronic Analogies

This repository contains supplementary code and visualizations for the research project **"La Zêta de Cohérence"**, exploring deep analogies between prime number theory and hadronic physics through spectral zeta functions.

## 🌟 Key Features
- Wave-based construction of prime-number oscillations
- Resonance analysis with Riemann zeta zeros
- Visualizations of spectral coherence patterns

## 📁 Repository Structure
- `technical_paper/`: LaTeX source and figures for the technical overview
- `code/`: Python scripts to generate prime waves and spectral analyses
- `data/`: Example parameters and generated data samples
